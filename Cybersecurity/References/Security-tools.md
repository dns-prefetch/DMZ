# List of security tools

Security tools are software or hardware solutions designed to protect computer systems, networks, data, and digital infrastructure from threats such as cyberattacks, data breaches, malware, and unauthorized access. These tools play a critical role in safeguarding sensitive information, ensuring privacy, and maintaining the integrity and availability of IT environments. Security tools can be categorized based on the types of threats they address and the layers of defense they provide.
