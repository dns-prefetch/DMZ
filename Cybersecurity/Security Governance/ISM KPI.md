Information Security Management key performance indicators (KPI) are frequently discussed in the literature, and between colleagues in the workplace, but rarely is it possible to find a list of actual KPI that organisations use.

The following list will help you assess not only your current security posture but also ensure that security efforts are progressing to toward your security goals, and that the protection of sensitive information, reduced risk, and improved overall security resilience.  Measuring progress toward your security program goals requires defining KPI then tracking the numeric data variances over time.  This is very much a moving averages game.

These KPI will help you measure the effectiveness and efficiency of your security programs. They are vital for tracking the security posture and understanding potential risks and vulnerabilities.

Below is a detailed list of Information Security KPIs across various domains, how to capture the number expression for each KPI will form the topic of another conversation.

### **3. Threat Intelligence**
   - **Threat Intelligence Alerts**: The number of actionable threat intelligence alerts received during a given period.
   - **Threat Intelligence Sharing**: Tracks how often the organization shares or receives relevant threat intelligence data with partners, industry groups, or governmental bodies.
   - **Detection of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: The frequency with which APTs or sophisticated cyberattacks are detected by the organization's security measures.

### **4. Security Awareness and Training**
   - **Employee Security Training Completion Rate**: The percentage of employees who complete mandatory security awareness training programs.
   - **Phishing Click Rate**: The percentage of employees who click on simulated phishing emails during security awareness training or exercises.
   - **Security Awareness Quiz Scores**: Average scores from internal security awareness quizzes, measuring employee knowledge of information security best practices.
   - **Number of Security Awareness Training Sessions Conducted**: Tracks the frequency of conducted training sessions, webinars, or awareness events on security topics.

### **5. Endpoint Security**
   - **Percentage of Endpoints with Latest Security Updates**: Tracks the percentage of endpoints (servers, workstations, mobile devices) that are fully patched and up-to-date.
   - **Number of Malware Infections**: Measures how often malware infections are detected across the organization's endpoints.
   - **Endpoint Protection Coverage**: The percentage of endpoints covered by up-to-date antivirus/antimalware software.
   - **Compliance with Endpoint Security Policies**: Percentage of endpoints that comply with corporate security policies (e.g., disk encryption, device control).

### **6. Data Protection**
   - **Data Encryption Compliance**: The percentage of sensitive data that is encrypted during storage and transmission.
   - **Data Loss Incidents**: Tracks the number of data breaches, leaks, or loss incidents over a given period.
   - **Data Backup Success Rate**: Percentage of successful backups performed in accordance with the defined backup policy.
   - **Access Control Effectiveness**: Tracks incidents of unauthorized access to sensitive data or resources.

### **7. Compliance and Auditing**
   - **Regulatory Compliance Status**: The percentage of compliance with key regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, ISO 27001).
   - **Number of Non-Compliance Findings**: The number of findings from security audits that indicate non-compliance with internal policies or external regulations.
   - **Audit Log Review Frequency**: How often system and security logs are reviewed by security personnel to ensure proper monitoring and auditing.
   - **Percentage of Access Reviews Completed**: Tracks the percentage of access control reviews completed for users, ensuring least privilege access is enforced.

### **8. Security Governance**
   - **Security Policy Violations**: Tracks the number of violations of the organization’s information security policies.
   - **Audit Results**: Tracks the number of successful versus unsuccessful audits of security controls and procedures.
   - **Risk Assessment Completion Rate**: Percentage of completed risk assessments compared to planned assessments for critical assets.
   - **Security Budget Utilization**: The percentage of the allocated security budget spent effectively on security controls, tools, and staff.

### **9. Network Security**
   - **Firewall Rule Violations**: The number of unauthorized or risky activities detected via firewall logs or firewall rule violations.
   - **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) / Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Alerts**: Number of malicious attempts detected by IDS/IPS systems.
   - **DDoS Attack Mitigation Effectiveness**: Measures how effectively the organization can identify and mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
   - **Network Segmentation Compliance**: Tracks how well network segmentation strategies are implemented to reduce the attack surface.

### **10. Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
   - **Number of Failed Login Attempts**: The number of failed login attempts detected over a given period, which could indicate brute-force attacks.
   - **Privilege Escalation Incidents**: The number of incidents where a user or system gains unauthorized access to elevated privileges.
   - **Time to Provision/Deprovision User Accounts**: The average time taken to create or disable user accounts based on role changes or employment status.
   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Adoption Rate**: The percentage of users utilizing multi-factor authentication across critical systems and applications. This should be 100%, because account password sniping and phishing attacks are widespread, so if you find any user accounts with MFA, then you need an immediate risk based response.
   - **Access Requests Approved vs. Denied**: The number of access requests that are granted or denied, which may highlight unnecessary access requests or risks.

### **11. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery**
   - **Disaster Recovery Test Success Rate**: The percentage of successful disaster recovery tests conducted on critical systems and data.

### **12. External Security Monitoring**

   - **Vendor Risk Management (VRM) Compliance Rate**: The percentage of vendors that meet your organization’s security and privacy standards.
   - **External Vulnerabilities Discovered**: Tracks the number of vulnerabilities discovered externally, such as from bug bounty programs or external penetration testing.

### **13. Security Tool Effectiveness**
   - **Tool Utilization Rate**: The percentage of the organization's security tools (e.g., SIEM, EDR, firewalls) actively used for their intended purpose.
   - **False Positive Rate in Security Alerts**: Measures the percentage of security alerts generated by security systems that turn out to be non-malicious (false positives).
   - **Security Tool Integration Efficiency**: Tracks how well different security tools (e.g., firewall, SIEM, IDS) integrate with each other for a cohesive security posture.

### **14. Cost of Security**
   - **Cost per Security Incident**: Measures the average cost incurred per security incident, including remediation costs, legal fees, fines, etc.
   - **Return on Security Investment (ROSI)**: Calculates the return on investment for security tools, processes, and personnel to demonstrate the value of the security program.
   - **Total Security Spend vs. Budget**: Compares actual security spending against the planned budget for a given period.

### Conclusion

### **Key Considerations for Effective KPIs**
- **Relevance**: Ensure KPIs align with your organization’s strategic goals and risk management objectives.
- **Measurable**: KPIs should be quantifiable and tracked over time to identify trends and areas of improvement.
- **Actionable**: KPIs should provide actionable insights that can be used to inform decisions and improve security posture.
