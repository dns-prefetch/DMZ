# DMZ

I tried working a basic blog on Wordpress, but after some experimenting and messing around with pages, I found that I just cannot resist the convenience of writing articles in markdown and uploading them to Github.

# Moving to WordPress (cancelled)

The articles for this site are migrating to WordPress Disco Potato Factor [Disco Potato Factory Landing Page](https://discopotatofactory.wordpress.com/home/).

Public source code and binary artefacts will remain within this repository.
