After recent global events, I wanted to understand how fear and panic can take entire populations into a profoundly interesting mental state which I subsequently learned is called Mass Formation Psychosis.

Mass formation, or "mass formation psychosis," is a psychological concept that describes a phenomenon in which large groups of people adopt a shared belief or behavior that is disconnected from reality, often driven by fear, uncertainty, or manipulation. This collective mindset can lead individuals to become highly suggestible and act in ways that are irrational or harmful to themselves or society. The term gained attention in the context of social and political events where mass movements or widespread public behavior appear to defy logic or evidence. In such situations, a common feature is the dominance of a unifying narrative, often perpetuated by leaders or media, which overrides critical thinking and dissent.

Mass formation typically occurs in environments of extreme stress or crisis, such as during wars, pandemics, or political upheavals, where people are more likely to look for simple explanations or scapegoats. Under these conditions, individuals can lose their sense of autonomy and follow the collective belief system of the group, even if it leads to harmful consequences. While the term is often used in discussions of political or societal manipulation, it is important to note that not all mass movements or collective behaviors fall into this category, and the concept remains controversial and debated within psychological and sociological circles.

And so I started researching how so called "legacy news" organisations and the newer globalised "social media" organsiation were using propaganda, nudge, and manipulation to set narritive positions that excluded alternative critical thinking, especially when the critical thinkers were outstanding highly accomplished professionals with many decades of experience, often resulting in the professionals loosing jobs and having their reputations undermined by agencies that often referrred to themselves as "Fact Checkers" but who subsequently turned out to be alternative information machines with lucrative contracts provided by the same entities paying for or controlling the naratives of the legacy and social media organisations.

The opaque and often complex trails of information control and manipulation started my research leading into the field of Fifth Generation Warfare, which is not a new field of activity, and often there is uncertainty whether Fifth Generation Warfare is actually a Fifth Generation set of techniques or a popular rebranding of ancient Information Warfare perpetrated by every organisational of power unit seeking to destract or undermine an opposition.

Fifth-generation warfare (5GW) represents an evolution in the nature of conflict, characterized by the use of non-traditional tactics and the blending of physical, cognitive, and informational domains in warfare. Unlike earlier generations of warfare, which focused on direct military engagement (1GW), the use of technology and industrial capacity (2GW), maneuver and firepower (3GW), and combined arms and decentralized strategies (4GW), 5GW emphasizes subtle, decentralized methods to influence, manipulate, and disrupt adversaries without direct confrontation. It integrates cyber warfare, information manipulation, economic pressure, and psychological operations to shape narratives and sway public opinion, often exploiting social media, misinformation, and economic vulnerabilities. In 5GW, the battlefield is not limited to a physical space but extends to the minds of individuals and populations, making the distinction between combatants and non-combatants increasingly blurred.

One of the defining features of 5GW is its reliance on ambiguity and deniability. The actors behind such strategies·whether state actors, non-state groups, or even corporations·can often remain anonymous or unaccountable, making it difficult for traditional military forces to respond effectively. In 5GW, wars are waged through economic sabotage, political subversion, and the manipulation of social and cultural divisions, often without the need for a single shot to be fired. The goal is not necessarily to achieve immediate military victory but to erode an adversary¦s cohesion, legitimacy, and will to fight, causing long-term destabilization. As a result, 5GW challenges traditional notions of warfare, defense, and security, requiring new strategies and a broader understanding of what constitutes a threat in the modern world.

To be clear about 5GW, the techniques utilised by the active agencies are propagranda, nudge, and mind control to create Mass Formation Psychois in the minds of the intended targets, but also groups of people who might consider themselves to be innocent bystandards, or simply not involved.  In the world of online legacy media, and social media systems, it is virtually impossible to not be involved, you will either be the direct inteded target or a bystanding that will be used as a "useful idiot" (this is a standard term, check in the list below).  There is just no way you can avoid getting involved, unless of course, you unplug your television and radio, replace your smart phone with a simple voice and text device, and abandon the internet, but even then,  you probably need to stop having normal human relations with anyone with a functioning mind.

Complimentatary to 5GW there is cyberwarfare refers to the use of digital attacks by one nation or entity to disrupt, damage, or infiltrate the critical infrastructure, information systems, or military capabilities of another. Unlike traditional warfare, which relies on physical force, cyberwarfare targets virtual spaces, including networks, data, and devices. It can involve a wide range of tactics such as hacking, data breaches, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and malware deployment to cause disruption or gain intelligence. The intent behind cyberwarfare can vary from sabotage and espionage to the strategic manipulation of public opinion or undermining an adversary¦s military readiness. The anonymity of cyber operations, combined with the speed and low cost of attacks, makes it an attractive tool for state and non-state actors alike.

The consequences of cyberwarfare can be far-reaching, affecting not only military operations but also civilian sectors like healthcare, finance, and energy. Critical infrastructure such as power grids, communication networks, and water supply systems are especially vulnerable to cyberattacks. In addition to direct damage, cyberwarfare can also erode public trust, sow confusion, and destabilize political systems. The challenge in addressing cyberwarfare lies in the difficulty of attribution, as attackers can mask their identities and origins, making it harder for targeted nations to respond effectively. Given its potential for widespread impact and escalation, cyberwarfare is increasingly seen as a significant component of modern geopolitical conflicts, requiring new frameworks for defense, deterrence, and international cooperation.
