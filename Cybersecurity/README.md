# 5 thoughts for this year

1. **“There are two types of organisations: those who have been hacked, and those who don’t know they’ve been hacked yet.”** — often attributed to former Cisco CEO John Chambers.
2. **"Passwords are like underwear: don’t let people see it, change it often, and you shouldn’t share it with strangers."**
3. **“I don’t always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production.”** — A humorous nod to the risky (and often regrettable) move of testing live code.
4. **"The most secure password is one you can’t remember."** — Highlights the paradox between secure passwords and usability.
5. **"To err is human, but to really foul things up requires a computer."** — A classic reminder of the scale of errors possible in the digital age.
